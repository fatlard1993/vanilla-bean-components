# Demo Server

The demo server provides documentation, demos, and examples for evaluating and referencing component features, props, and behaviors.

## Start

`bun run demo`

> The server is available @ [localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999)

## Development

`bun run dev`

The demo server is also a great place to work on the components when run in "dev mode"; which adds hot reloading, component names as class names, and some additional log outputs.
